1. Introduction

In this document we outline a name resolution mechanism for "local" name resolution of hostnames
in a certain type of peer-to-peer overlay networks like e.g. yggdrasil. The term "local" does 
not refer to link-local type locality as in e.g. mDNS but to locality in the sense of a set 
of nodes, N_local, being under a single entities control.

In these kind of networks the IP address of a node is derived from a public/private key pair 
which is usually unique per node. Additionally it is initialized randomly. We propose to change
this initialization scheme to make the IP address predictable.

2. Local node key pair derivation

We first initialize a random key pair, K_main, from which all other key pairs for the local nodes 
are derived deterministically (as described below). This in turn makes the IP adresses of the local
nodes known since they in turn are determined deterministically from the nodes' key pair.

Given K_main, consisting of the private key K_main_private and public key K_main_public, the 
derivation of a nodes key pair, K_node, proceeds as follows. K_main_private is XOR'ed with the nodes' 
local hostname resulting in K_node_private and the public key K_node_public is derived from 
K_node_private.

So instead of each node initializing its K_local during installation it is configured with K_main. 
On startup it rederives its K_local from K_main and the hostname. It could even detect hostname 
changes and automatically rederive its K_local.

3. Name resolution for local nodes

A name resolution service knowing K_main_private could respond to a name resolution request for a 
name n precisely as above: K_main_private XOR n, then rederive the public key and finally the IP
address which it returns.

To practically implement this the name resolution service needs to know K_main_private. This service
could run on a privileged node, but to achieve more decentralization we propose to let each node
be a name resolution service itself. This is similar in spirit to Yggns [1]. Upon node installation
the node would have to register as a name resolution service on the host where it is installed.
